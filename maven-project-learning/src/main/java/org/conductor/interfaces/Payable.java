/** This is an interface to use on different lind of classes. Key points to remember: we use
 * an interface when classes that belong to different inheritance lines have the same behavior or fields.
 * That is why an interface defines common behavior for things, people and systems. Another thing: an
 * interface as abstract methods that are implicitly private static and final; the fields are
 * implicitly static and final.
